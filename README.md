# Flutter Notes

## Where To?

- **Q: Where to call `super.initState()`?**<br/>
  A: Always first, before any custom initialization logic.<br/>
  [Implementations of this method should start with a call to the inherited method, as in super.initState().](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/initState.html)

- **Q: Where to call `super.dispose()`?**<br/>
  A: Always last, after releasing resources and cancelling subscriptions.<br/>
  [Implementations of this method should end with a call to the inherited method, as in super.dispose().](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/dispose.html)

- **Q: Where to call `super.didChangeDependencies()`?**<br/>
  A: Not specified by docs. Doesnâ€™t matter. You can call it first by convention, for consistency.<br/>

- **Q: Where to call `super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget)`?**<br/>
  A: Always first.<br/>
  [Implementations of this method should start with a call to the inherited method, as in super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget).](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/didUpdateWidget.html)

- **Q: Where to call `super.activate()`?**<br/>
  A: Always first.<br/>
  [Implementations of this method should start with a call to the inherited method, as in super.activate().](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/activate.html)

- **Q: Where to call `super.deactivate()`?**<br/>
  A: Always last.<br/>
  [Implementations of this method should end with a call to the inherited method, as in super.deactivate().](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/deactivate.html)

## Should I?

- **Q: Should I use `const` constructors in Flutter?**<br/>
  A: Yes.<br/>
  [Use const constructors on widgets as much as possible, since they allow Flutter to short-circuit most of the rebuild work.](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/best-practices)
